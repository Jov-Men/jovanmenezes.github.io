							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I am a Graduate Student at Cornell University, pursuing my Master of Science (M.S.) degree with a major in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Electrical & Computer Engineering. I am currently a researcher at the Laboratory for Intelligent Systems & Controls (LISC), here at Cornell, conducting research in the domain of control systems, robot perception, and human-robot collaborative systems under the guidance of Dr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvia_Ferrari">Silvia Ferrari</a> (<a href="https://www.mae.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/silvia-ferrari">John Brancaccio Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</a>).</p>
						    </p> I sincerely believe that a large potential of robots and automated systems is still untapped and yet to be unleashed on the world. In the coming years, advancements in this field will play a huge role in not just shaping our industries & economic divisions, but also our lifestyle and thus, our society at large. I wish to play a vital in propelling the development of robotic systems and that is why I enjoy tackling some of the most challenging and convoluted problems in the field during my research.<p>

							<h2>Academic Projects</h2>
							<p>For me, completing projects is one of the most interactive & effective ways to implement the knowledge that I learn in classroom into real-world systems. Below you will find some of my completed projects that have provided me valuable knowledge & exposure to the challenges faced when applying engineering concepts in real-world.</p>

									<h3>Development of an Autonomous Hexapod Robot</h3>
									<h5>Built a six legged robot with 3 degrees-of-freedom/leg using manufacturing processes like Laser Cutting and Fused Deposition Modeling. Implemented algorithms like Visual-SLAM (using the Extended Kalamn Filter) for localizing & mapping and navigation planner using the trajectory rollout approach & D* search algorithm to achieve autonomy in environments void of GPS.</h5>

									<h3>Localization, Mapping, and Motion Planning for Wheeled Robots</h3>
									<h5>Implemented Particle Filter fusing measurement data from a depth sensor & a beacon sensor for localizing the robot in an environment. Used a geometric approach to update the map constantly based on the readings from the depth sensor. Probabilistic Roadmaps & Dijkstra's Algorithm were used to help the robot navigate in the environment and travel to desired locations.</h5>

									<h3>Vehicle Steering using Model Predictive Control</h3>
									<p></p>
									<h5>Designed and implemented a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) while taking into account the physical constraints for steering an automobile such that it changes lanes and avoids oncoming obstacles. Also formulated a mathematical model of the disturbances parallel to the vehicle due to strong winds which provided a better understanding of the performance of the controller in real-world scenarios.</h5>

									<h3>Robot Writing</h3>
									<p></p>
									<p></p>
									<h5>The goal of the project was to teach a robotic manipulator (Widowx 250s) with 6 degree-of-freedom to replicate the alphanumeric characters written by a human. Four approaches were implemented to achieve this: Dynamic Movement Primitives, Recurrent Neural Networks, Model Predictive Control, and simple waypoint tracking. We also performed comparative evaluation of each of these techniques for a given set of characters.</h5>

									<h3>Color sorting robotic manipulator</h3>
									<h5>A 3 degree of freedom robotic manipulator was designed and constructed using stainless steel bars as the links and DC servo motors as the actuators. A gripper was developed using gear mechanism to pick up objects and place them into specified locations based on their color. Arduino was used to control the motion and perform decision-making process based on the measurement values from the color sensor.</h5>

									<h3>Detection, Classification, Localization and tracking using multiple pinhole camera</h3>
									<h5>A sensor model of the pinhole pan & tilt camera was developed in MATLAB for detection, localization and tracking of targets (both stationary and moving targets) as a point as well as a rigid body. The algorithm takes into account the physical constraints of the sensor and enables it to track efficiently the target in the workspace. A basic pretrained convolutional neural network is also used to classify the detected targets throughout the simulation.</h5>
