							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I am a research at the Laboratory for Intelligent Systems and Controls (LISC), at Cornell University, under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvia_Ferrari">Silvia Ferrari</a> (<a href="https://www.mae.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/silvia-ferrari">John Brancaccio Professor of MAE</a>). My research focuses on the fundamental concepts of perception, decision-making, and control applied to human-robot collaboration, cyber-physical systems, and underwater robotics. I am also one of the very few students at Cornell to have graduated with a master's degree with minors in two separate engineering fields.</p>
						    </p> I firmly believe that the immense potential of robotics and autonomous systems remains largely untapped, awaiting exploration and application worldwide. In the upcoming years, progress in this domain will significantly influence not only our industries and economic landscapes but also our daily lives and consequently, the broader society. I aspire to play a crucial role in driving the advancement of robotic systems. That's why I find fulfillment in addressing some of the most complex and intricate challenges within this field throughout my research endeavors.<p>

									<h3>Development of an Autonomous Hexapod Robot</h3>
									<h5>Built a six legged robot with 3 degrees-of-freedom/leg using manufacturing processes like Laser Cutting and Fused Deposition Modeling. Implemented algorithms like Visual-SLAM (using the Extended Kalamn Filter) for localizing & mapping and navigation planner using the trajectory rollout approach & D* search algorithm to achieve autonomy in environments void of GPS.</h5>

									<h3>Localization, Mapping, and Motion Planning for Wheeled Robots</h3>
									<h5>Implemented Particle Filter fusing measurement data from a depth sensor & a beacon sensor for localizing the robot in an environment. Used a geometric approach to update the map constantly based on the readings from the depth sensor. Probabilistic Roadmaps & Dijkstra's Algorithm were used to help the robot navigate in the environment and travel to desired locations.</h5>

									<h5>Designed and implemented a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) while taking into account the physical constraints for steering an automobile such that it changes lanes and avoids oncoming obstacles. Also formulated a mathematical model of the disturbances parallel to the vehicle due to strong winds which provided a better understanding of the performance of the controller in real-world scenarios.</h5>

									<h5>The goal of the project was to teach a robotic manipulator (Widowx 250s) with 6 degree-of-freedom to replicate the alphanumeric characters written by a human. Four approaches were implemented to achieve this: Dynamic Movement Primitives, Recurrent Neural Networks, Model Predictive Control, and simple waypoint tracking. We also performed comparative evaluation of each of these techniques for a given set of characters.</h5>

The algorithm takes into account the physical constraints of the sensor and enables it to track efficiently the target in the workspace. A basic pretrained convolutional neural network is also used to classify the detected targets throughout the simulation.</h5>
